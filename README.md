# Blockhosts

Log parser / blocker using Golang and nftables.

## Installing

1. Make sure you have nftables installed on your system
2. Download the binary to `/usr/local/bin/`
3. Download the config to `/usr/local/bin/`
4. Update hosts.deny
5. Enjoy

You can also do the Super Lazy install of:

`curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/palner/blockhosts-nft/refs/heads/main/install_blockhosts.sh | bash`

_If you do the super lazy install, please check the `/etc/hosts.deny` for accuracy as well as adding your IP to `/usr/local/bin/bhconfig.json`._

## Details

### Downloading the binary

```
cd /usr/local/bin
wget https://github.com/palner/blockhosts-nft/raw/refs/heads/main/binary/blockhosts-nft
chmod +x blockhosts-nft
```

### Download the config

```
cd /usr/local/bin
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/palner/blockhosts-nft/refs/heads/main/bhconfig.json
```

#### Update the config

There is a section (in `json`) called **Allowed**. Add your CIDRs as desired.

Examples...

```json
"Allowed": [{"cidr":"192.168.0.3/32"}]
```

```json
"Allowed": [{"cidr":"192.168.0.0/16"},{"cidr":"1.1.1.1/32"},{"cidr":"10.0.10.0/24"}]
```

```json
"Allowed": [{"cidr":"192.168.0.0/16"}]
```

### Update hosts.deny

Examples:

#### Debian/Ubuntu or boxes using /var/log/auth.log

```
#
# hosts.deny	This file describes the names of the hosts which are
#		*not* allowed to use the local INET services, as decided
#		by the '/usr/sbin/tcpd' server.
#

sshd : ALL : spawn (/usr/local/bin/blockhosts-nft) : allow
sshd : ALL : allow
```

#### CentOS or boxes using /var/log/secure

```
#
# hosts.deny	This file describes the names of the hosts which are
#		*not* allowed to use the local INET services, as decided
#		by the '/usr/sbin/tcpd' server.
#

sshd : ALL : spawn (/usr/local/bin/blockhosts-nft -ssh=/var/log/secure) : allow
sshd : ALL : allow
```

## Other Flags

- `ssh`: log file to parse
- `set`: nftables set name (default is `APIBANLOCAL`) (Note: will be created if it doesn't exist)
- `log`: log file for output (default is /var/log/blockhosts.log)
- `xtra`: `true|false`. default false. Used for extra logging
- `full`: `true|false`. default false. Read full log (vs 5000 line chunks)

Example:

`/usr/local/bin/blockhosts-nft -ssh=/var/log/secure -xtra=true -set=SSHCHAIN`
